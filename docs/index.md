# Annotating machine learning resources with Schema.org and its Bioschemas extension

## Summary of the tutorial 
1. Intro to schema.org (why is it useful)
2. Intro to bioschemas (software / application) -> link to some DOME entries
3. Annotate training dataset by using the dataset profile 
      -    Help needed: DOME Registry select one entry
4. Annotate software
      - Not manually write markup, but rather use bio.tools (need to have the tool in the registry)
      - Help: select relevant ML software
5. Show how to validate markup and evaluate FAIRness of the resource.
FAIRChecker, F-UJI, other tools for assessment.


## Understanding Schema.org 

Schema.org is a collaborative, community activity with a mission to create, maintain, and promote schemas for structured data on the Internet, on web pages, in email messages, and beyond. Schema.org vocabulary can be used with many different encodings, including RDFa, Microdata and JSON-LD. These vocabularies cover entities, relationships between entities and actions, and can easily be extended through a well-documented extension model. Over 10 million sites use Schema.org to markup their web pages and email messages. Many applications from Google, Microsoft, Pinterest, Yandex and others already use these vocabularies to power rich, extensible experiences.

## Understanding Bioschemas

Bioschemas is a community initiative to improve the findability of biological data. Bioschemas is a profile of Schema.org, i.e., it reuses terms from Schema.org and extends them when necessary. Bioschemas is a community initiative and it is open to everyone who wants to contribute. The Bioschemas community is composed of people from different backgrounds, including researchers, developers, publishers, and funders.
