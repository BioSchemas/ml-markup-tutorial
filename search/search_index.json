Schema.org vocabulary can be used with many different encodings, including RDFa, Microdata and JSON-LD. Over 10 million sites use Schema.org to markup their web pages. Many applications from Google, Bing, Yandex and others already use these vocabularies to more easily index web content and provide rich result snippets to web users.</p>"},{"location":"#bioschemas","title":"Bioschemas","text":"<p>Bioschemas is a community initiative to improve the findability of life science data. Bioschemas mostly results in metadata profiles. The profiles are based on Schema.org, i.e., it reuses terms from Schema.org and extends them when necessary. Bioschemas profiles are defined by communities which specify the metadata terms that are relevant for their domain, and their level of importance. The agree on metadata terms that are required, recommended, and optional. Several profiles are available to describe for instance datasets, softwares, workflows, genes, proteins, or training materials. </p>"},{"location":"#step-2-annotating-a-ml-training-dataset-with-metadata-from-the-bioschemas-dataset-profile","title":"Step 2.
